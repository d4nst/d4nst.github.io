I am a third-year PhD candidate at [University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk/). The topic of my PhD is face recognition and I am currently focused on researching new techniques to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks for this task. I am currently based in London working for [IDscan](https://www.idscan.com/), the company that partially funds my PhD, as a part of their research team.

My passion is machine learning, in particular deep neural networks and its applications, so I spent a great part of my time increasing my knowledge in this field. I also love coding and building cool things. Aside from that, I like to travel, play basketball, binge-watch TV shows and photography.
