I am a third-year PhD candidate at [University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk/). The focus of my research is the development of new techniques to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks for face recognition. I am currently based in London working for [IDscan](https://www.idscan.com/), the company that partially funds my PhD, as part of their research team.

My passion is machine learning, in particular deep neural networks and their applications, so I spent a great part of my time increasing my knowledge in that field. I also love coding and building cool things. Aside from that, I like to travel, play basketball, binge-watch TV shows and photography.
